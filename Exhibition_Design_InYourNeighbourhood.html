    <td height="210" align="justify" class="style_text_black">The importance of small producers  in our-days economy was the discussion subject in the course „Small producers in your neighbourhood“, with special focus on the region Nordrhein Westfalen, Germany. After certain input, I decided to put me in the skin of a small producer and experimented to commercialise my own product during the anual Design Parcours Ehrenfeld/   Passage   2012 - Interior Design Week in Cologne.<br />
The product developed was a bed which the design was based mainly on the catabolism and anabolism notions.   That means, the bed can &quot;grow and shrink&quot;, like a metabolism. The structure was also inspired in three ideas: sustainable/qualitative, flexible/adaptable, simple/airy. The goal was not to design the most innovative bed, instead a sustainable and qualitative product.<br />
The exhibition  embraced the bed concept and accordingly transmit the &quot;metabolic&quot; idea. Here the spacial metaphor was achieved through a light and shadows game, that originated a subtle and constant ambience change under the bed structure. Also  the reflexion of the bed emphasized this idea. At the same time, the room should achieve a cosy emotion, but not a literal one like the recreation of a sleeping room, rather through the presence of bed elements like pillows, sheets, covers and sleeping masks.</td>
