    <td width="500" height="223" align="justify" class="style_text_black"><p>The exhibition  was  the assemble of the  concept &quot;Living in a Megacity&quot;. It integrated  a conference cycle about Megacities organised by Institute of Geography from the Cologne University, and which toke place in the Wissenschaftszentrum in Bonn, Germany, in April 2013. The aim was to present the researched work  done by the Institute of Geography in the cities Guangzhou and Dhaka, and parallel show them with Tokyo, the great world wide megacity.<br />
      Hence the target audience of the exhibition was mainly experts, it was fundamental the collaboration of the Institute of Geography, as well as from other researchers, in order to obtain accurate and &quot;in situ&quot; information about the studied cities.<br />
      Hereby it was possible to test same of the &quot;Living in a Megacity&quot; main ideas. For instance, how the  different hightÂ´s of the tower structures work together, accordingly with the variable mega-cities population density. Or also, how fexible and reuseble the towers structures can be, 
    therefore the existing 3,50 meter Tokyo tower had to fit in a 3,10 meter high room. But it was also possible to experiment different approches,  like for example, and having in attention the target audience, their capatibablity to guess what city was each tower according to their dimensions, and so not identifying the portraid mega-cities.</p></td>
